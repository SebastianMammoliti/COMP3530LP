						<h1> Introduction and Overview </h1>
						<h2> Introduction </h2>
						<p>
						I think this course is one which focuses on helping us get ready for the corporate world. Combined with COMP3500 and COMP3120, this seems like an incredibly important part of my degree from what I have seen so far. All of these courses focus on what will happen in the real world, why those things will happen and why those things will happen. This course in particular deals with the overarching systems point of view, basically how software fits into larger systems that have heaps of parts. Without knowing how these systems work, I think it is an unviable expectation to get a job ever in this field.

						<h2> Reflection on this week </h2>
						<p>
						Developing a software system to work with a greater system seem borderline impossible. I’m not really sure how they do it. The airport baggage handling system alone, while not seeming very complex looking at it like a normal person, looks insanely difficult to implement correctly when broken down into its parts and really looked at from a systems point of view. All of this is necessary though! People have to do it or society just will not work. It’s really great that we are learning about this because not only does it help appreciate the people that have already done it, but hopefully we can learn how to do it too. Without these giant systems of programs, hardware and sheer manpower working together, nothing would get done, we would still be in the Stone Age! Definitely not anywhere near what society is today, and that’s why this is so important.

						<h2> Questions </h2>
						<h3> What do you hope to gain from taking this course?</h3>
						<p> Taking a direct quotation from the lecture slides, Sommerville says: Some students, especially those who are self-taught, do not appreciate the need for disciplined approaches to software development. Personally I have no idea how to handle or write software if I was looking to implement it in a large scale project. The connection between software, hardware and users is INTEGRAL in creating working systems and my goal is to really understand how it fits in. </p>
						<h3>Tell us about another system failure blamed on software, but in which other 'system' issues were contributing factors? </h3>
						<p> In 2010, National Australia Bank had a situation where most of their ATMs went offline for a while. This left thousands of people unable to access their money. It was caused when a corrupt file was uploaded into the overnight system, causing widespread errors and shutdowns. This was blamed on the software’s inability to handle such a file and therefore on the architecture itself. While this is true, it did seem to be a fault of the software, it was found out that a user had loaded the file incorrectly. Is it really the software’s fault entirely then? I don’t feel as though it can be solely blamed on software. If you put a fork in a toaster and were outraged that it broke, it’s not very fair.</p>
